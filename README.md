A dungeon/quest expansion to CrossCode, currently in development!

*The world of Shadoon has a diverse set of challenges to offer to Seekers, testing their kinetic and intellectual skills alike. Many journeys on the continent develop and culminate as part of a sublime gaming experience, but some Seekers notice the lack of climactic experiences in Autumn's Rise and Fall and wonder if there's something more to these simple areas than meets the eye.*

*As it turns out, they're right.*

# Prerequisites

[CCUpdaterUI](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCUpdaterUI/releases) is a tool simplify mod installation.

If you do not have it downloaded, then you can download it by clicking the link above. 
Extract the zip. It will contain the executable that you will be using later. 

## CCLoader

CCLoader can be downloaded or updated through CCUpdaterUI. It will give you a prompt if it could not locate CCLoader inside your preferred CrossCode installation path.

## Installing dependencies
